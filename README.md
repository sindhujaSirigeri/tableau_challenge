2.  **Key Metrics Analyzed**:
    
    -   Total number of trips recorded each month.
    -   Ridership growth and trends.
    -   Peak hours of bike usage for each month.
    -   Analysis of top and bottom stations for starting and ending journeys.
    -   User type distribution and average trip duration.
3.  **Visualization and Reporting**:
    
    -   Created various visualizations to represent the key metrics and insights.
    -   Designed dashboards to provide a clear and concise overview of the analysis.
    -   Developed a Tableau story to present the findings in an interactive format.

## Visualizations

The following visualizations were created to support the analysis:

1.  **Total Trips per Month**: A bar chart showing the total number of trips for each analyzed month.
2.  **Peak Usage Hours**: Line graphs indicating the peak hours of bike usage during the analyzed months.
3.  **Top and Bottom Stations**: Maps and bar charts displaying the top 10 and bottom 10 stations for starting and ending journeys.
4.  **User Type Distribution**: Pie charts showing the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers.
5.  **Average Trip Duration**: Bar charts comparing the average trip duration for different user types.

## How to Use

1.  **Tableau Workbook**: The analysis and visualizations are available in a Tableau workbook. You can access the Tableau Public profile to view the interactive dashboards and story.
2.  **CSV Files**: The raw data files used for the analysis are included in the `data` directory of this project.
3.  **Python Scripts**: The scripts used for data loading, preparation, and analysis are included in the `scripts` directory.

## Conclusion
